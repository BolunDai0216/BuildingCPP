Tutorial on the C++ building process and how to build using CMake. I believe the C++ building process has tortured many more than me, this tutorial is my attempt to solve that problem once and for all. I will first show the most basic version of compiling C++ code, then go through the compiling process, finally show how to compile projects using CMake.
